# Colour Sorting Machine using Arduino and Python

## Project Overview
This mini project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **Colour Sorting Machine** developed as part of the **B.Tech Electronics and Communication Engineering curriculum**.

The system identifies the colour of an object using a colour sensor and processes the data through a microcontroller. The detected colour is displayed on an LCD module, and the setup can be extended to sorting mechanisms using actuators.

## Objectives
- To detect the colour of objects using a colour sensor  
- To process sensor data using a microcontroller (Arduino)  
- To display the detected colour on an LCD module  
- To understand hardware–software integration using Python  

---

## Hardware Components Used
- Arduino UNO  
- Colour Sensor (TCS3200/TCS230)  
- 16×2 LCD Display  
- LEDs  
- Connecting wires  
- Power supply  

---

## Working Principle
The colour sensor detects reflected light from the object. Based on the intensity values of red, green, and blue components, the microcontroller determines the colour of the object. The identified colour is then displayed on the LCD.

Python is used for serial communication and data visualization, enabling better monitoring and debugging of the system.
